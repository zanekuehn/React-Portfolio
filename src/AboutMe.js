    <h2 className="h2">About me</h2>
    <p>I have a broad working background.
        I have worked as a shop laborer sweeping floors and filling orders, 
        all the way up to a technical position of  Non Destructive Examination position performing work 
         in oil refineries.Through the positions that I have held I know what is important to me.
         I decided to change into the development field in order to have good work/life balance, have a position where I can constantly be learning.</p>

            I was able to see how being a developer can be through my wife who is currently a developer.
            The environment and work life balance showed me what being a developer can be like  in that sense. 
            Her passion for writing code intrigued me, I personally didn't understand the appeal of solving a coding problem until I started coding myself. 
            It is satisfying when you hit the “AH-HA”moment of the problem that you have been trying to solve.

            I find web development to be one big puzzle that is challenging and keeps my brain constantly working and learning. 
            I love to learn new things and be proficient at them. 
            Web development provides an avenue onto which I can always be learning something new and not feel stagnant in my job.

        While working as a shipping clerk I worked with an outdated inventory program.
        The whole time I worked with this program I couldn't help thinking there has to be a more efficient way of doing this, with not so many errors. 
        With this thought in mind Im glad i decided to make a career change into being a developer.
